<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹hi my name is Mau</h1>

I'm a **Frontend developer** based in Guadalajara, Mexico. I discovered my love for web development 2 years ago when I was introduced to it by my mentor and wrote my first `Hello World` in JavaScript. Since then, I have dabbled in many languages and technologies, like React, JavaScript, SASS, HTML, and many more. now i'm eager to make a meaningful contribution to the industry.

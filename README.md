I'm a **Frontend developer** based in Guadalajara, Mexico. I discovered my love for coding two years ago when I was introduced to it by my mentor and wrote my first `Hello World` in JavaScript. Since then, I have dabbled in many languages and technologies, but my focus has been on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
